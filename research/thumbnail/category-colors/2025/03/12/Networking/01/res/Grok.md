### Notes on Selection
- **Quiet Luxury Style**: All colors are desaturated and soft, avoiding bright or harsh tones, to mirror the refined palettes of Brunello Cucinelli and Loro Piana.
- **Networking Relevance**: Blues and greens dominate the list, as they are commonly associated with technology, trust, and connectivity—key themes in networking.
- **Readability**: Each color is light enough to ensure your black `TH-BG-Title` text in Carlito font remains legible on the `TH`.
- **Order of Preference**: The top variants (e.g., #B0C4DE, #AFEEEE) balance domain specificity with premium appeal, while later ones (e.g., #F5F5F5, #E0FFFF) are more neutral or subtle, offering flexibility.

These colors should enhance the visual coherence of your `PF-L` (portfolio list) while distinguishing "Networking" within your diverse set of `DAs`. Let me know if you’d like adjustments or additional variants!
