AWS Networking Engineer Needed for Client VPN Connectivity Issues for Urgent Issue

## Description
We are seeking a highly skilled AWS Networking Engineer to help us diagnose and fix connectivity issues with our AWS Client VPN setup.  
We have an urgent situation and need to resolve for our company (NITROcrete LLC).  
This occured after an End of Life for an Akami product we were using.

### Our current environment:
- Single VPC (no on-premises connectivity)
- AWS Client VPN endpoint configured with mutual certificate authentication
- Client access via AWS VPN Client and OpenVPN
- VPN transit secured with IPSec via Akamai

### The problem:
We are unable to connect successfully to the VPN using the AWS VPN Client. 
We’ve attempted to configure the Client VPN endpoint but are experiencing persistent DNS resolution failures upon login.

### Scope of Work:
- Diagnose why our AWS VPN Client cannot establish a successful connection
- Review the current Client VPN endpoint setup and associated configuration (CIDR block, routing, DNS, network ACLs, security groups)
- Identify root cause of DNS resolution failures
- Provide clear next steps and a recommended solution path
- Assist with implementing the fix so the VPN is functional

### Deliverables:
- Problem Diagnosis — identify why connections are failing and document the cause.
- Resolution — guide us through the changes needed, and assist in applying them, so our AWS Client VPN endpoint works reliably.

### Required Skills:
- Strong hands-on experience with AWS VPC networking (subnets, route tables, security groups, NACLs)
- Deep understanding of AWS Client VPN endpoints and mutual TLS authentication
- Experience troubleshooting with AWS VPN Client and OpenVPN
- Familiarity with DNS resolution in AWS environments (Route 53, DHCP options sets)
- Ability to explain findings clearly and document changes

### Engagement Model:
- Short-term engagement (diagnosis + fix)
- Immediate availability preferred
