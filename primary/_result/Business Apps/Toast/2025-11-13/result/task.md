Toast POS Specialist Needed for Menu + GL Code Optimization

## Description
We are seeking an experienced Toast POS specialist to review and optimize our current menu setup. 
We’re encountering issues where menu items are not properly mapped to the correct GL codes, resulting in inaccurate financial reporting.

Your primary task will be to audit the existing menu configuration, identify mapping errors, and ensure all items properly align with the correct GL accounts. 
The goal is to produce accurate revenue reports at the end of each event.

Because our business operates as an event venue (not a traditional restaurant), we need someone familiar with unique Toast setups, including bar menus and one-off event configurations rather than standard dining or online orders.

### Responsibilities:
- Review and correct menu item configurations within Toast
- Ensure all menu items map correctly to the appropriate GL codes
- Optimize reporting for accuracy and clarity
- Provide recommendations for the best way to structure bar/event menus

### Ideal Candidate:
- Proven experience setting up or managing Toast POS systems
- Deep understanding of menu management, modifiers, and revenue mapping
- Experience with event-based or bar service operations preferred
- Knowledge of financial reporting and GL code integration
- Ability to communicate clearly and provide documentation of updates

### Deliverables:
- Clean, verified menu structure in Toast
- Accurate GL code mapping for all items
- Recommendations for future event or bar setups
- Optional: Process documentation or a short guide for staff reference

###
If you have successfully optimized Toast POS setups for non-traditional venues or event-based operations, we’d love to hear from you.
 We need someone who can audit the system, correct the mappings, and advise on the best setup for event-based and bar sales (not a standard restaurant setup).
