QuickBooks Online Sales Tax Setup Expert Needed

## Description
I have a setup issue in Quickbooks I need help with.     
My clients are all within the Bay Area, but each one is in different cities and counties with their own sales tax rate.    
Throughout the year I have fairly large hardware/computer related orders to each of them, and each one has a different sales tax rate.     
Now this is where it gets different.   
I have a 3rd party tool I’m setting up that manages my client support needs, billing, and hardware quotes and orders.    
It needs to bring in the sales tax rate for each client.    
I’m using quickbooks online and the new sales tax setup makes no sense, and seems that sales tax rate needs to be added manually.    
The customer section has a box checked for “sales tax” but there is nothing further than that.    
When my 3rd party tool brings in clients, there is no associated sales tax rate.  
I need to have clients sales tax rates setup and flowing to 3rd party tool.
