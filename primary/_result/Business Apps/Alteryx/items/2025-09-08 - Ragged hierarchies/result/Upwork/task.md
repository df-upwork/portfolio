Expert Alteryx Developer Needed for Data Analytics Project

## Description
We are seeking an expert Alteryx developer to assist with our data analytics project.

There is a very specific initial problem to solve with Alteryx that can't make use of any pushdown to databases i.e. all data is coming via excel and all processing has to be done natively within Alteryx.

We have a ragged hierarchy expressed in a set of tables and the complexity is that each hierarchy can be composed of sub-hierarchies that can be expressed at different levels.  This is solved easily in SQL with a conditional outer join, but this is proving tricky to replicate in Alteryx natively.

If we can nail this first requirement, there are ~40 other tables and flows that need to have logic translated from SQL into native alteryx.
