# The client's task
## Title
Consult on Bot Mitigation

## Description
We have a website that has display banner ads that are sold directly to clients (not programmatic).  
The client's marketing agency has reported an increase in bad bot ad fraud, specifically SIVT through Double Verify's metrics.  
We're currently using Cloudflare's Pro Plan with their new AI Labyrinth and the bot super fight mode configured.  
I'm looking to hire someone to advise on how we might correct this situation going forward.  
We'd like to avoid solutions like Datadome that require server side packages, but are open to that, if that's the best option.
