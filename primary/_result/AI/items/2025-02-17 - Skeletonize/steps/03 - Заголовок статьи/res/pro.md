### 1. `T๏`
**Title**: Advanced Polygon Skeletonization with DCE-Based Pruning and Endpoint Extension.
**Rationale**: This title is direct and technical. It explicitly mentions all three required components (`Rs`): "Skeletonization," "Pruning," and "Endpoint Extension." [cite_start]It highlights the core of your solution by naming the specific advanced algorithm, "DCE-Based Pruning" (Skeleton Pruning by Contour Partitioning with Discrete Curve Evolution) [cite: 22, 297][cite_start], which is a key selling point from the provided article (`A`)[cite: 19].

### 2. `T๏`
**Title**: Computational Geometry: Robust Polygon Skeletonization, Pruning, and Boundary Extension.
**Rationale**: This title frames the project within the professional field of "Computational Geometry," as requested. [cite_start]The word "Robust" emphasizes a key benefit of the DCE method—its stability in the presence of boundary noise and variations[cite: 24, 100]. It addresses all three requirements: "Skeletonization," "Pruning," and "Boundary Extension."

### 3. `T๏`
**Title**: End-to-End Polygon Skeletonization: Medial Axis Generation, Contour-Based Pruning, and Edge Extension.
**Rationale**: "End-to-End" conveys a complete, self-contained solution. [cite_start]"Medial Axis Generation" is a more formal term for skeletonization[cite: 228]. [cite_start]"Contour-Based Pruning" accurately describes the methodology from the article (`A`) without using an acronym, making it understandable to a broader audience[cite: 22]. All three stages (`Rs`) are clearly listed.

### 4. `T๏`
**Title**: Topology-Preserving Skeletonization via DCE Pruning and Endpoint Extension.
[cite_start]**Rationale**: This title highlights a critical and highly desirable feature of your algorithm: it is "Topology-Preserving"[cite: 25, 77, 105, 122]. This is a significant advantage over many other pruning methods, especially for complex shapes with holes, as mentioned in your solution (`S` §7.4, §7.5). The title names the main method ("DCE Pruning") and covers all `Rs`.

### 5. `T๏`
**Title**: Generating Clean Skeletons: A 3-Stage Process of Skeletonization, DCE Pruning, and Extension.
**Rationale**: This title is benefit-oriented ("Generating Clean Skeletons") and clearly outlines the structure of the work. It explicitly states it is a "3-Stage Process" and names all three required stages (`Rs`), providing immediate clarity on the project's scope and outcome.

### 6. `T๏`
**Title**: Medial Axis Transformation with DCE-Driven Pruning and Boundary Finalization.
**Rationale**: This option uses highly professional terminology. [cite_start]"Medial Axis Transformation" is the formal name for the process[cite: 571]. "DCE-Driven Pruning" sounds sophisticated and accurate. "Boundary Finalization" is an elegant way to describe the final step of extending the endpoints to the polygon's edges. All `Rs` are professionally described.

### 7. `T๏`
**Title**: From Noisy Polygons to Clean Skeletons: A Pipeline for Skeletonization, Pruning, and Extension.
**Rationale**: This title adopts a problem-solution narrative. [cite_start]It addresses the core challenge that the DCE algorithm solves: removing redundant branches caused by boundary noise ("From Noisy Polygons to Clean Skeletons")[cite: 38, 39]. It uses the professional term "Pipeline" to describe the integrated workflow and enumerates all three `Rs`.

### 8. `T๏`
**Title**: High-Fidelity Shape Representation via a Skeletonization, Pruning, and Extension Workflow.
[cite_start]**Rationale**: This title elevates the project's purpose from a simple conversion to "High-Fidelity Shape Representation," which is a primary goal of skeletonization in computer vision and pattern recognition[cite: 33, 34]. It uses the term "Workflow" to suggest a robust, multi-step process and explicitly lists all three `Rs`.

### 9. `T๏`
**Title**: Parameter-Controlled Skeletonization with Advanced Contour Partition Pruning and Edge Extension.
**Rationale**: The client's task (`T`) specifically requires a parameter to control the pruning level. This title directly highlights that key feature ("Parameter-Controlled"). [cite_start]It accurately describes the method as "Advanced Contour Partition Pruning" [cite: 22] and includes all three `Rs`, making it highly relevant to the original request.

### 10. `T๏`
**Title**: A Complete Skeletonization Solution: Pruning via Discrete Curve Evolution and Endpoint Extension.
**Rationale**: This title presents the project as a "Complete Solution," instilling confidence. [cite_start]It puts the most innovative part—the pruning algorithm—front and center by naming "Discrete Curve Evolution (DCE)"[cite: 155]. "Skeletonization" is the overarching subject, and "Endpoint Extension" is the final step, thus covering all `Rs`.
