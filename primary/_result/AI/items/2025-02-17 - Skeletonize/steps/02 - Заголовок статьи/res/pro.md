### 1.
* **Title:** Advanced Polygon Skeletonization in Python: Initial Thinning, DCE-Based Pruning, and Endpoint Extension.
* **Rationale:** This title is direct and technical. It explicitly names the three required stages (`Rs`). Mentioning "DCE-Based Pruning" (Discrete Curve Evolution) immediately highlights the advanced, research-backed nature of the solution, appealing to clients who need a high-quality, non-trivial algorithm.

### 2.
* **Title:** Robust Polygon Skeletonization Pipeline: Skeleton Generation, Advanced Pruning, and Boundary Extension.
* **Rationale:** This title uses the word "Pipeline" to suggest a complete, multi-stage process. "Robust" implies the solution handles noise and complex shapes well, a key benefit of the algorithm used. The terms "Skeleton Generation," "Advanced Pruning," and "Boundary Extension" are clear, benefit-oriented descriptions of the core requirements.

### 3.
* **Title:** High-Fidelity Medial Axis Transform: A 3-Stage Process of Skeletonization, Pruning, and Extension.
* **Rationale:** "High-Fidelity" promises a result that is accurate and true to the original shape's core structure. "Medial Axis Transform" is a more formal term for skeletonization, which can attract clients with a background in computational geometry. Describing it as a "3-Stage Process" makes the scope of work clear and methodical.

### 4.
* **Title:** Complete Polygon Skeletonization Solution: Generation, Topology-Preserving Pruning, and Edge Extension.
* **Rationale:** "Complete Solution" positions the project as a comprehensive answer to a client's problem. [cite_start]Highlighting "Topology-Preserving Pruning" is a major technical benefit derived from the source article[cite: 24, 105, 486], which is crucial for shapes with holes and signals a high level of expertise. "Edge Extension" is a concise and professional term for the final step.

### 5.
* **Title:** Research-Driven Polygon Skeletonization: Medial Axis Extraction, Intelligent Branch Pruning & Endpoint Filling.
* **Rationale:** The phrase "Research-Driven" immediately establishes the sophisticated nature of the work, setting it apart from basic library calls. "Intelligent Branch Pruning" frames the simplification step as more than a simple filter, and "Endpoint Filling" provides a visually descriptive name for the extension requirement.

### 6.
* **Title:** Python Geometry Processing: Full Polygon Skeletonization with Refined Pruning and End-Point Extension.
* **Rationale:** This title is broader, targeting clients looking for general "Python Geometry Processing" skills and using this project as a prime example of that expertise. "Full" emphasizes completeness, while "Refined Pruning" suggests a high-quality, detail-oriented approach that goes beyond standard methods.

### 7.
* **Title:** From Raw Polygon to Clean Skeleton: A Python implementation of Skeletonization, Contour-Based Pruning, and Extension.
* **Rationale:** This title uses a "From X to Y" structure, which is effective for storytelling in a portfolio. "Raw Polygon to Clean Skeleton" clearly communicates the transformation and the value provided. [cite_start]"Contour-Based Pruning" accurately describes the advanced methodology [cite: 22] in an accessible way.

### 8.
* **Title:** Multi-Stage Polygon Skeletonization: Extraction, Advanced Simplification, and Boundary Connection.
* **Rationale:** "Multi-Stage" effectively describes the methodical, step-by-step approach taken to solve the problem. "Advanced Simplification" is a more accessible term than "Pruning" for some clients, while still conveying sophistication. "Boundary Connection" is a clear and descriptive alternative for the extension step.

### 9.
* **Title:** Custom Skeletonization Algorithm in Python: Featuring Medial Axis Generation, Noise-Resistant Pruning, and Edge Extension.
* **Rationale:** "Custom Algorithm" highlights that this is not an off-the-shelf solution but a tailored implementation requiring deep understanding. [cite_start]"Noise-Resistant Pruning" is a strong selling point, directly addressing a common problem (unwanted branches from boundary noise) that the implemented research paper is designed to solve[cite: 38, 198, 24].

### 10.
* **Title:** Precision Polygon Skeletonization: A Process of Core Axis Generation, Smart Pruning, and Full Extension.
* **Rationale:** "Precision" emphasizes the accuracy and high quality of the final output. "Core Axis Generation" is another professional term for the initial skeletonization. "Smart Pruning" is a catchy, non-technical way to convey the intelligence of the pruning algorithm, and "Full Extension" implies the skeleton perfectly reaches the boundaries as required.
