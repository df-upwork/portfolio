Netsuite bulk upload for Asset Revaluation

## Description
I need to do an asset revaluation in Netsuite for some assets (Fixed Assets - Transactions - Asset Revaluation).
When trying to import a csv for a bulk update, this error appears: "**TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of undefined**".
Need someone specifically with experience in mass csv uploads for Asset Revaluation in Netsuite.
