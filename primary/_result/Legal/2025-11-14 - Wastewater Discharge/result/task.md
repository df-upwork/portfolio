## Title
Regulatory Approval Consultant for Industrial Wastewater Discharge

## Description
We are seeking an experienced consultant to assist in obtaining local town approval for the discharge of industrial wastewater resulting from alkaline hydrolysis (water cremation). 
The majority of these facilities currently discharge directly into their towns' wastewater stream.  
As this is a fairly unknown process, it has been difficult for me to obtain their approval.
The towns have been specifically concerned with BOD and pH.

The ideal candidate will have a strong background in environmental regulations, wastewater management, and local government processes.
Your expertise will be crucial in navigating the approval process and ensuring reasonable engineering controls be put in place. 
If you have a proven track record in this area, we would love to hear from you. 
Please provide details of your relevant experience.
