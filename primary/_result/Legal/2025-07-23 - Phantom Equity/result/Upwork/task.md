Startup Lawyer for LLC-Based Angel Investment Structure

## Description
We have a Delaware-based single-member LLC and are looking to raise a few angel investments.  
We're unsure about the best structure for this and are looking for guidance.  
Here’s what matters to us:  
- We want to keep the LLC as a single-member entity (no conversion to a multi-member LLC or C-Corp)
- The approach should be as simple as possible
- Ideally, it should have no tax or K-1 implications for the angels

We’re also looking for a founder-friendly advisor agreement template, something that allows us to grant equity (or equivalent) while ensuring the terms protect the company.
